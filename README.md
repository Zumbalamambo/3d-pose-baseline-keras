# About 3d-pose-baseline

3d-pose-baseline predict 3d pose from 2d pose.

Input is 16 keypoint. Each keypoint has 2 axis.

Output is 16 keypoint. Eash keypoint has 3 axis.

Output should be denormalize using  mean value.

Mean value has 32 keypoint, So you should remove unused dimension. Mean value is sparse.
